SHIP_TSUKUYOMI_IOT|Tsukuyomi-Class Frigate (Decommissioned)

SHIP_TSUKUYOMI_IOT_DESC|The Tsukuyomi class of light frigates were designed in 2190 for military operations throughout the solar system. They were the first of their type and laid the groundwork for modern tactical frigates, with their quintuplet reactors serving as immense sources of power for their powerful thrusters. Following phase-out of nuclear saltwater rockets in military service, many were scrapped or sold off to private military contractors and corporations. \n\nCourtesy of the Sin Space Engineering shipyards, this unit has been fully demilitarised and refurbished for operations within the rings. Its saltwater reactors have been replaced with three modular containment vessels for modern NTR system retrofitting, and its bow torpedo tubes have been departitioned to expand its hold and add two forward-facing high-stress hardpoints and four auxiliary equipment bays.

SHIP_OCP209_DD_DESC|The 214-DD is a version of the OCP-209 specially adapted for mining operations within the rings. The structure supporting its consumable bays has been hollowed and plated to extend the raw cargo volume, and additional power infrastructure permits the installation of standard cargo bay accessories. \n\nDespite the obvious benefits, the pocket makes handling ore awkward, and the reduced onboard mineral hold space means captains tend to be more reliant on auxiliary hardware than on most other vessels.

SHIP_MADCERF_CIV|MAD-CERF (Civilian Refit)

SHIP_MADCERF_CIV_DESC|This civilian refit, made in collaboration with Obonto Microengineering, introduces a number of modifications for the diverse requirements of the ring environment. Its compact top-mounted habitat has been relocated to the bow and replaced with an expanded OCP-standard centrifuge, increasing its effective crew capacity to eight. Further, the docking bay has been enclosed with a mesh basket and the clamps removed to support mining operations, and its rear bulkhead bears an enormous sliding door for acceptance of large cargo. Much of the bow substructure has also been replaced by hold volumes, lending the vessel more processed mineral space than any other vessel on the civilian market.

SHIP_MADCERF_DESC|The Machines Astro-Dynamiques Cernunnos Modèle II, otherwise known as the MAD-CERF, is the staple ship of salvage companies within the rings of Saturn. Its heavily-armoured bow, rated for asteroid belt travel, is an inelegant but effective solution to the many hazards posed by interplanetary excursions. Twin reactors on either side of the vessel each power their own pair of torches and maneuvering thrusters.

SHIP_OBERON|UMC Oberon MLP-60

SHIP_OBERON_DESC|The Oberon MLP-60 is a curious vessel manufactured by the United Machine Cults. Originally an autonomous vehicle launched by electromagnetic rail cannons for orbital racing events, it was outmoded by later fusion-propelled units, but enthusiasts quickly bought up the remaining stock and it eventually found its way to the rings. Six belt radiators, three at either side, cool its high-performance reactor and partially shield its exposed fuel tanks, though are hardly needed due to the vessel's comical number of translatory thrusters. \n\nMultiple modifications have been undertaken to make the vessel appropriate for operation within the rings: its magnetic contacts have been cleverly retrofitted into two high-stress hardpoints, interface infrastructure has been built into the small cargo bay in the bow to support mineral processing units (barely, and with meager onboard space allotted to support them), and a HAL-9001 luxury lifepod serves as a comfortable cockpit and crew compartment.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_FAB|SSE Voyager Fabricator

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_FAB_DESC|A custom-made and completely unlicensed monstrosity from Sin Space Engineering that became popular among ringside miners in the 2260s. The fabricator unit of a Voyager RSLS MPU has been torn out and placed further up in the cargo bay, along with a small mineral storage volume to replace its specialised feed hoppers. \n\nDue to the replacement of its power bus with a lower-grade distributor, moderate power efficiency losses are to be expected over the standard unit. \n\nDisclaimer: Nakamura Dynamics does not provide a warranty for this unit, and does not recognise it as part of its range of products, express or implied. Use of modified equipment may incur damages and present unexpected hazards.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_FAB_SPECS|Print power draw: 120 MW \nPrinting capability: drones, ammunition \nCargo capacity: 2,000 kg / mineral (12,000 kg total) \nMass: 5,000 kg \nManufacturer: Sin Space Engineering / Nakamura-Obonto

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_FAB_MANUAL|Requires an MPU to properly utilise. \nPassively increases onboard processed cargo volume. \nProcessed ore stored in seperate containers, with capacity limited per mineral type. \nProduces kinetic ammunition from a 9:1 ratio of iron to vanadium. \nProduces nanodrone components from a 4:1 ratio of iron to platinum. \nTakes up some space in the cargo bay.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_A|Rasamama RP-25

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_A_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions RP-25 is a low-profile ore preprocessor designed to melt ice from mineral chunks within a vessel's cargo bay. The unit taps the reactor turbine bleed line for thermal power and requires very little electrical energy to function. \n\nRemass is recovered by running process exhaust through a condenser panel on the vessel's outer hull. Rasamama MS recommends monthly flow tests followed by hot gas purges to prevent fouling.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_A_SPECS|Ice melt rate: 10 kg/s \nPower draw: 25 KW / chunk \nRemass processing efficiency: 30% \nMass: 750 kg \nManufacturer: Rasamama Material Solutions

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_B|Nakamura Big MT

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_B_DESC|Nakamura Dynamics' Big MT Ore Preprocessor utilises the fundamental principles of its operation to its advantage when processing ore chunks. Free steam in the cargo bay is superheated by the unit's massive toroidal radiator, quickly ablating ice it comes into contact with and preheating the ore within them for more efficient processing. \n\nWhile some process steam can be reclaimed as propellant, its high temperature means that a significant amount is lost to its condenser vents.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_B_SPECS|Ice melt rate: 25 kg/s \nPower draw: 125 KW / chunk \nMPU mineral efficiency: 120% \nRemass processing efficiency: 10% \nMass: 2,000 kg \nManufacturer: Nakamura Dynamics

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_MANUAL|Reduces ice mass of chunks within a large area. \nReplenishes propellant. \nIncreases MPU efficiency multiplicatively. \nLarger cargo holds have greater processing reach. \nProcesses multiple ore chunks simultaneously. \nPower requirements and processing speed listed per chunk. \nDoes not extract minerals or destroy chunks.

SYSTEM_CARGO_MOD_AMORPH4_DESC|While the Cothon-217's experimental storage geometry was met with limited success, Conlido RVM was still keen on the concept. Agreements were made between ship manufacturers for trials and, false starts and missed deadlines not withstanding, the aMorphIV Hold Conversion Kit eventually entered the market. \n\nIts modular parts can be retrofitted to all ship systems currently available on the market, and employs the same fundamental principles as its vessel of origin.

SYSTEM_CARGO_MOD_AMORPH5_DESC|The Titan Heavy Industries MD-5 Hold Kit is well-known among shipyard engineers for its accordion-style collapsing internal volumes. Lessons were learned from prior implementations and the hardware takes up much less space in the hold as a result, but its compact linear actuators and precision assembly translate to high upfront costs.
